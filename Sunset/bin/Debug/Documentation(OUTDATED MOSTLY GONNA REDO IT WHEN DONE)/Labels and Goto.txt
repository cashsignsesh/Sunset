; Labels are markers in the file that can be made anywhere outside of blocks
; and jumped to from anywhere via the goto keyword. They are not directly 
; accessible outside of the containing file and modifiers do not apply to labels.

; A reason that a label is significant given the correct siutuation,
; is because instructional code can be written outside of blocks.

; An example:

TOGGLE_GUI

dllref(User32,int,str,str,int) MessageBoxA int

int i becomes 123

~start ; This line defines a label named "start"

if(i,=,0) {
	
	; This jumps to the not yet defined "here" label
	goto(here)	
	
}

--i

goto(start) ; Usage of the goto keyword in this manner is similar to that of a loop
; ^ this goto keyword jumps to the aforementioned start label

~here
MessageBoxA(0,"Here","",0)
