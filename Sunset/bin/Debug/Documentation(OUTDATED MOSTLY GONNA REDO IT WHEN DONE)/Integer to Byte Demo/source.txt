; Variables can be converted to lower byte size variable types at 
; the risk of losing data. Data will be lost in some particular scenarios, 
; i.e: a integer with a size of >255 is being converted to a byte, 
; or an integer with a size of >65535 is being converted to a short.

; This is a healthy example of Integer to Byte conversion via casting:

int myNum becomes 123
byte otherNum becomes cast(myNum,byte)

retn(otherNum)

; Expected exit code: 123. (7Bh)

; Exit code result:  123. (7Bh)
