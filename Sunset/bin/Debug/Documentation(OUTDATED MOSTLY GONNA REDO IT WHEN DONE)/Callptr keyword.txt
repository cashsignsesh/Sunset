;This is an unsafe keyword because it requires the parameters to be their expected values, 
;though there are no restrictions (as the compiler doesn't know any)
;It also returns an unsigned integer as the compiler also can't know the return value from a PTR,
;however that can be converted/used as any 4 byte var types such as classes or arrays.
func(int i) test int {
	
	retn(i)
	
}

retn(callptr($test,123))

; Result:
; Exit code 7B (123.)
