int i becomes 0

; Loop a boolean, in this case "true", resulting in an infinite loop
while (true) {
	
	if(i,=,10) {
		
		break
		
	}
	else {
		
		++i
		
	}
	
}

; Resetting the variable i to 0
i becomes 0

; This is the equivalent of the above loop without using break
; (Except shortened and therefore optimized)
while (i,=/=,10) {
	
	++i
	
}
