; Using multi foreach (mforeach) many arrays can be looped through in a single block
; The format for the parameters is item,array,item0,array0,item1,array1 ....
; Only arrays are valid (Aug 24 06:53 2021)
; The parameters must be divsible by 2 and they are in pairs: 'item,array' item corresponds to the next listed parameter
; The collections used in the multi foreach loop can have different lengths, however the loop will break after the collection with the smallest length reaches its last item

; An example:

TOGGLE_GUI

dllref(User32,str,str,int,int,int) cdecl:wsprintfA int
dllref(User32,int,str,str,int) MessageBoxA int

int# arr becomes #,(1,2,3,4,5)
int# arr0 becomes #,(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
int# arr1 becomes #,(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048)

str buffer becomes "No. #: ##: ###"
str format becomes "No. %d: %d: %d"
str empty  becomes ""

mforeach(n,arr,n0,arr0,n1,arr1) {
	
	; This block will loop 5 times - lengthof(arr)
	; Local variables defined at this point:
	; int n
	; int n0
	; int n1
	
	wsprintfA(buffer,format,n,n0,n1)
	MessageBoxA(0,buffer,empty,0)
	
}
