; Public, Private, Local, Pullable, Static and Constant are modifiers for variables, functions or both.
; 'Private' is applied by default to any instances which don't declare an accessor modifier (Public, Private, Local, Pullable)

; Variable and Function modifiers:

; public - If an instance is declared with the 'public' modifier, it can be accessed from any file anywhere.
; private - If an instance is declared with the 'private' modifier, it can be only accessed from its containing file.
; local - If an instance is declared with the 'local' modifier, it can be only accessed from within its containing folder.
; static - If an instance is declared with the 'static' modifier, it can be accessed without a class instance. Static functions cannot access non-static instances.

; Variable exclusive modifiers:

; pullable - If an instance is declared with the 'pullable' modifier, it can be accessed from any file anywhere, except it can only be read (pulled), but not modified.
; constant - If an instance is declared with the 'constant' modifier, it must be given a value immediately and can not change.
