Current:

 - move StringUtil into String and make it static (also go through all lib files and replace StringTool instances with String and test each 1)

 - Enum
 - free array heaps on block end (when the block they were defined in closes) or if they weren't defined in a block, on class end
 - blogic (pb)
 - for loops - Set the parser to parse the first parameter normally but set the block to the for block
 - anonymous functions
 - magic #'s, neural network, creative ways all to give unique performance !

TODO/FIXME :: in solution
  ~~~
REDO DOCS, TEST (INCLUDE) ALL FEATURES OF LANGUAGE AND ALL UPDATED LIBS. (FIRST OPTIMIZE LIBS SO THEY WON'T CHANGE MUCH AND A LEGACY CHANGE (DEPRECATION) WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD)
  ~~~
LET ARRAYS BE PASSED EXTERNALLY EASILY (i.e without +8, maybe make automatic.)
  ~~~
LINUX LIBS & LINUX SUPPORT
  ~~~
STANDALONE LIBS, ALLOW OS TO BE MADE ENTIRELY USING SUNSET

   - Only one class reference block should be made per compilation, so if it already exists from a previous Parser, don't make a new one, instead reference the initial one
