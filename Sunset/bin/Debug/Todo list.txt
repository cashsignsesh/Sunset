Current:

 - dowhile {...} (like do{...}while(...))
 - free array heaps on block end (when the block they were defined in closes) or if they weren't defined in a block, on class end
 - blogic (pb)
 - for loops - Set the parser to parse the first parameter normally but set the block to the for block
 - or keyword (See bottom of doc)
 - fix the issue where if a class gets too big (byte size) there is a crash

TODO/FIXME :: in solution
  ~~~
REDO DOCS, TEST (INCLUDE) ALL FEATURES OF LANGUAGE AND ALL UPDATED LIBS. (FIRST OPTIMIZE LIBS SO THEY WON'T CHANGE MUCH AND A LEGACY CHANGE (DEPRECATION) WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD)
  ~~~
LET ARRAYS BE PASSED EXTERNALLY EASILY (i.e without +8, maybe make automatic, or for native support maybe just add Arrays.toNative(arr). Be sure to count for array styles because static arrays shouldn't have +8.)
  ~~~
LINUX LIBS & LINUX SUPPORT
  ~~~
STANDALONE LIBS, ALLOW OS TO BE MADE ENTIRELY USING SUNSET, (using arraystyle.static arrays to write bytes and such). Also make SetOrigin keyword that is like the org instruction in fasm
  ~~~
   - Only one class reference block should be made per compilation, so if it already exists from a previous Parser, don't make a new one, instead reference the initial one
   - Let enums be of different types other than native var int (i.e add syntax ENUM(shr) and there can be shr enums like in C# public enum yatta : UInt16 { ... })
   - magic #'s, neural network, creative ways all to give unique performance !
   
   
; or keyword: (abs is a synonym for absolute without making a new func in memory)   
public static func(int num) absolute or abs int {

	if (num,<,0) {
		retn(num*(-1))
	}
	retn(num)

}

; It can also be done like this:
func test or test0 or test1 {

}
