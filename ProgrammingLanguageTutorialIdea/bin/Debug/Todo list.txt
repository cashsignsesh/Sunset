Current:
; - cleanup repo and try to get Sunset syntax recogized on github... remember to update yt channel description links

 - Better exception handling (character/line identification, file name)
 - Clean up files in Debug folder
 - Github sunset language identification
 - Enum
 - move StringUtil into String and make it static
 - free array heaps on block end (when the block they were defined in closes) or if they weren't defined in a block, on class end
 - Classes inheriting eachother, and update all current sunset libs for this
 - blogic (pb)
 - for loops - Set the parser to parse the first parameter normally but set the block to the for block
 - anonymous functions
 - magic #'s, neural network, creative ways all to give unique performance !

TODO/FIXME :: in solution
  ~~~
REDO DOCS, TEST (INCLUDE) ALL FEATURES OF LANGUAGE AND ALL UPDATED LIBS. (FIRST OPTIMIZE LIBS SO THEY WON'T CHANGE MUCH AND A LEGACY CHANGE (DEPRECATION) WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD)
  ~~~
LET ARRAYS BE PASSED EXTERNALLY EASILY (i.e without +8, maybe make automatic.)
  ~~~
LINUX LIBS & LINUX SUPPORT
  ~~~
   - Only one class reference block should be made per compilation, so if it already exists from a previous Parser, don't make a new one, instead reference the initial one

Classes Inheriting Eachother:
INHERIT: ClassName,ClassName0. ; Colon to indicate begin searching, comma to split, period to end query

; More proper syntax to test:
; INHERIT:ClassName,ClassName0
; INHERIT:ClassName.
; INHERIT: ClassName, ClassName0.
; INHERIT: ClassName, ClassName0 .
; INHERIT: ClassName , ClassName0 .
; INHERIT:ClassName .
; INHERIT : ClassName,ClassName0 .
; INHERIT :ClassName,ClassName0.
; INHERIT: ClassName.
;
; INHERIT :ClassName,
; ClassName0
;.
; 
; INHERIT:
; 	ClassName,
; 	ClassName0,
; .
